All data excepting the Alzheimer study are saved as .RData format, which can be directly loaded into R. 
Genes and barcodes with zero expression are already filtered out.

Temporary analyses results are also saved as .RData so that they can be directly loaded when running the scripts. 
Otherwise one can recover the commented codes (starting with #) and rerun analyses.
